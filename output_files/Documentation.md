# Fibonacci Sequence Generator Script

This Python script defines a function called `fibonacci` that generates and returns the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

## Function Definition
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    # Initialize the first two numbers in the sequence
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    
    # Generate the rest of the sequence up to n
    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
        
    # Return the generated sequence
    return fib_sequence
```
## Input and Output Variables
The function `fibonacci` accepts one input variable, which is an integer `n`. The output of the function is a list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence up to (and including) the `n`th number.

| Input Variable | Description                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| n              | An integer representing the number of numbers in the Fibonacci sequence to generate |

| Output Variable | Description                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| fib_sequence    | A list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence up to (and including) the `n`th number |

## Interaction between Input and Output Variables
The function takes an integer input `n` and generates a corresponding list output `fib_sequence` containing the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The generation of this sequence is done by starting with the initial two numbers, 0 and 1, and then iteratively adding the last two numbers in the sequence to generate the next number until the desired length (`n`) is reached.
