#### Code Description

The provided Python script is a function called `parse_pdf_to_string` that takes a file path as input and returns the text content of the PDF file as output. The function uses the PyPDF2 library to read the PDF file and extract the text from each page.

#### Input Variables

| Variable   | Description                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| file_path  | The path to the PDF file that needs to be parsed. |

#### Output Variables

| Variable       | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| text_content   | The extracted text content of the PDF file.       |

#### Code Explanation

1. The script first imports the `PyPDF2` library.
2. The `parse_pdf_to_string` function is defined, which takes the `file_path` as a parameter.
3. The function opens the PDF file in binary mode using the `open` function and assigns it to the `pdf_file` variable.
4. It creates a `PdfReader` object `pdf_reader` using the `PdfReader` class from `PyPDF2`, passing the `pdf_file` as an argument.
5. It initializes an empty string variable `text_content` to store the extracted text.
6. The function then iterates over each page in the PDF file using a `for` loop.
7. For each page, it extracts the text content using the `extract_text` method of the `page` object and appends it to the `text_content` variable.
8. After extracting the text from all the pages, the PDF file is closed using the `close` method of the `pdf_file` object.
9. Finally, the function returns the `text_content` variable, which contains the extracted text content of the PDF file.

#### Example Usage

```python
file_path = "path/to/pdf/file.pdf"
text = parse_pdf_to_string(file_path)
print(text)
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `parse_pdf_to_string` function to extract the text content from a PDF file located at the specified `file_path`. The extracted text is then printed to the console.
